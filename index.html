    <h2>The Imbalance of Culture Fit</h2>
    <p class="Author-page">by Matt Griffin</p>
  <p class="intro para">Part of getting to a better place in the new year is recognizing where we
    have sway, and going past our own discomfort to create positive change in
    ourselves and in the world. Those of us who have a role in the hiring process
    can do better by thinking critically about culture fit. Matt Griffin challenges
    us to consider whether it actually creates the kind of team that’s the best
    for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make us comfortable by surrounding us
    with people largely like ourselves in ways that aren’t relevant to the business.
